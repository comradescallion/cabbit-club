                    <strong>TOWNSEND</strong> is a work of fiction<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('fiction')">[9 comments]</a> written by an anonymous and currently unknown author<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('author')">[4 comments]</a>, reportedly on an independent blog<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('blog')">[3 comments]</a> that was taken down some time before the story would reach popularity.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The work, formatted as an official document or report, possibly from the government, went over the phenomenon of a small town in Pennsylvania which seemingly acted as a digestive system for some creature. This includes the residents of the town. However, the clinical language of the work tries its best to avoid this description outright, dancing around it and using technical terms in order to obfuscate the horror.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The work goes on to describe the "TOWNSEND EFFECT": Most who enter are initially thrilled to find such an inviting and friendly community, and end up making the choice to move there. The horror largely comes from the way the friendliness of the 'people' leads many to complacency. It lures them in. Notably, whenever someone disappears, a new house appears at the town's end. It is implied that the person/people who live there wear the same faces as the ones who disappeared, but treat them as entirely separate entities.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The story abruptly ends with a note saying that there will be an effort to bar off the city, as there is a risk that if it keeps growing it could start bleeding into cities and other towns and put people at risk. The final line reads: "This page will be updated when progress has been made on this front."
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The original story in its entirety can be found here: <a href="https://pastebin.com/mbRi23sb" target="_blank" class="wiki-link text-blue-400 break-all">https://pastebin.com/mbRi23sb</a><a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('pastebin')">[4 comments]</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The story has been praised for its inventive storytelling and concise yet effective worldbuilding.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    A second<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('second_version')">[4 comments]</a> version of the story was written not long<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('timeline')">[3 comments]</a> after the original, by <a href="../townsend.html" class="wiki-link">Giles_the_X</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    This version takes the perspective of an actual narrator, who many have nicknamed Giles after the author. Giles must save his friend Wallace<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('wallace')">[8 comments]</a> from the town of Townsend<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('town_name')">[3 comments]</a>. On his journey, he encounters a similar atmosphere to the one mentioned in the original story. Finally, he meets Aglaope<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('aglaope_name')">[4 comments]</a>, who agrees to help him. After they devise a plan to find Wallace, they are implied to have sex<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('implication')">[5 comments]</a>. Giles wakes up in the middle of the night and records an audio clip seemingly to gloat about the experience, but is interrupted by Aggy<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('aggy_name')">[3 comments]</a> revealing her monstrous nature. As Giles makes his escape, the house is implied to become fleshy, and starts falling part.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Giles makes his way to his car and drives past many residents. He sees something at the center of town, later revealed by an image at the end to be a strange flesh-like opening in the ground<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('flesh_opening')">[3 comments]</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Eventually, he sees "Wallace"<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('fake_wallace')">[3 comments]</a>, who obviously does not act like the person Giles knew. Wallace's house forms at the end of town, and Giles is able to escape.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    The story ends with Giles reminiscing about his friend, and recounting a nightmare he had which makes the true nature of the town a little clearer<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('ending_meaning')">[3 comments]</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    This rewrite of the story brought it to the relative popularity it has today<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('rewrite_reception')">[3 comments]</a>, although it was met with mixed reception. Many argue that the focus on a wise-cracking protagonist took the creepiness out, while others argue that the addition of actual characters to follow made this version better to follow, that it gave it stakes, and that the original is boring. Some noted its similarities to classic tales such as The Odyssey<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('odyssey_comparison')">[4 comments]</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    A fandom culture has arisen around Townsend, with the most popular ships being Giles x Wallace<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('ship_wallace')">[7 comments]</a> and Giles x Aggy<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('ship_aggy')">[4 comments]</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Aglaope (nicknamed Aggy because no one could remember how to spell or pronounce Aglaope) became a bit of a mascot of the story<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('mascot_debate')">[3 comments]</a>, appearing in fanart has having disheveled dark hair, piercing green eyes (often bleeding), melting skin, and intestines wrapped around her body, often mimicking chains.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Townsend is now better known for becoming a sore topic to anyone who brings it up, so we at The Pasta Creependium would appreciate if talk about it stops leaking into discussions of other, completely unrelated works. Thank you.<a class="citation" onclick="openSidebar('mod_complaints')">[5 comments]</a>
