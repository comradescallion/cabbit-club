                            <p>Hello. I come to you all with a confession. I have never considered myself a very superstitious man, but I believe I may have encountered something... well, let me set the stage.</p>
                            <p>See, the other day, my friend Wallace took a trip. Which, immediately was out of the ordinary for him. He's a bit of a shut in, you get the type. But when I tell you... he had become obsessed with something over the past few weeks or so. He called it a conspiracy, which, I suppose is nothing new for him... but the other day, he left to go... "find it." What "it" is, I don't know, but I haven't heard from him since. He isn't answering his cellphone, his Skype account hasn't been active... I'm worried about him. So I'm starting this blog as I try to find him to document anything I might find.</p>
                            <p>And what I fear most... is that my psycho friend might have been onto something.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Entry 2 -->
                        <div class="mb-8">
                            <h3 class="font-bold text-creepy-red text-lg mb-2 uppercase tracking-widest border-b border-gray-800 inline-block">Entry 2</h3>
                            <p>I've been able to gather some info about what he was so obsessed with. He kept his window unlocked, so I was able to sneak in and get to his computer. He was researching this town called "Townsend". It's in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania... I hope he's not just harassing a bunch of Amish people.</p>
                            <p>It's hard to narrow down where this town is at all, there's barely any info about it online, and since it's such a generic name, my search results aren't the most helpful. For some reason I'm getting a bunch of random government websites whenever I search it up? Beats me.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, the nutcase left his notebook where he pinpointed the exact coordinates of the place. Latitude and longitude. Circled about a dozen times. I truly fear for what I find.</p>
                            <p>I leave tomorrow, taking tonight to gather some things... just in case. I never thought he'd be a paranormal investigator, but sometimes life throws you a strange, strange bone.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Entry 3 -->
                        <div class="mb-8">

                            <p>I find myself stopped on the side of the road because my GPS device is on the fritz. This has never happened before, it's one of the newest models.</p>
                            <p>It keeps sending me down these weird back roads, and I swear I've gone in a circle at this point. I don't care anymore, I'm close enough, I'll just find the nearest gas station and ask about Townsend.</p>

                            <p>Never mind, I found it. Driving for just another 30 minutes led me to the sign: WELCOME TO TOWNSEND! I cannot lie, I do not feel the most welcome.</p>
                            <p>Going to go ask around. I doubt there's anyone else named Wallace in a town this small.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Entry 5 -->

                            <p>So, I've driven around a bit, looking for... I dunno, a town hall or something, but it's just these houses that go on and on... this place is bigger than I thought. At least there are people walking around, or I'd start to get really unnerved.</p>
                            <p>I swear, though, some of them look... familiar? I've never been to Pennsylvania before, it took me about four hours to get over here, but I swear I've seen a handful of these faces before. I am someone who watches the news a lot, so... maybe a lot of people travel out of this town? And end up on the news? I'm probably just tired. Gonna find someplace to park and go around on foot.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Entry 6 -->
                        <div class="mb-8">
                            <h3 class="font-bold text-creepy-red text-lg mb-2 uppercase tracking-widest border-b border-gray-800 inline-block">Entry 6</h3>
                            <p>I can't tell if I'm experiencing some sort of Pennsylvanian culture shock, or if everyone here is just... awfully strange. Call me jaded, but everyone here is far too cheerful. A man walked up to me, asked if I was new in town and immediately offered to make me a welcome gift basket. I politely declined, saying I was just stopping by, and he seemed so disappointed. Then I walked for another ten minutes, and it happened again. It's not like they were, like, kindly old folks who grew up with that sort of neighborly hospitality from the 50s, or whatever. These people were my age.</p>
                            <p>Am I so unfriendly that this behavior would seem... alien to me? There's a chance, I suppose.</p>
                            <p>Anyway, I've got no leads as to Wallace's whereabouts. Every time I describe him to people, they just think for a while, and shrug their shoulders. Almost everyone I've talked to has commented about how people "generally don't pass through", so I must be mistaken. I'm starting to think they're right. Wallace probably just ran off to some basement UFO enthusiast gathering or something.</p>
                            <p>I'm looking for another hour, and then getting out of this creepy town.</p>
                            <p>Eh... I guess I'm glad they're all so happy. Hell, maybe Townsend is just that great. Not my type of place though.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Entry 7 -->

                            <h3 class="font-bold text-creepy-red text-lg mb-2 uppercase tracking-widest border-b border-gray-800 inline-block">Entry 7</h3>
                            <p>You know, maybe I'm starting to come around to Townsend.</p>
                            <p>I finally found someone with a lead. I was just about walking to my car, this lady in her yard caught my eye. I thought, whatever, I'll ask one more person, so I walk over and describe the situation, and when I describe him, her face actually sparks some recognition. She said she's saw him around for the first time a few days ago, and just assumed that he was either new or a reclusive guy who didn't leave his house much. Don't know how she was so accurate with that read, LOL.</p>
                            <p>It was getting dark out, so she invited me in, and dear readers, this is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in my life. Her piercing green eyes, her shoulder length hair, jet-black...
                            I'm almost glad no one else had any help before, haha. She made me a cup of coffee and we discussed what might be going on. She seems incredibly invested, which is a breath of fresh air from the small-talk niceties I've been dealing with all day.</p>
                            <p>We've devised a plan to track him down with the help of the town tomorrow morning. The layout of the town is... I don't know how to describe this, she showed me a map, and it seems almost... fractal-like? Almost like a spiral, expanding outward. But not really? It gave me a headache to look at too long, I take it it's one of those things that only makes sense if you've lived there long enough. Anyway, she knows people from the outer edges of town, and if we search from there inwards, we should find him before we reach the center of town.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime, however, I should get ready to go to bed soon. She so graciously invited me to stay the night so I wouldn't have to sleep in my car... although, unfortunately, her place is so small that there isn't really anywhere else to sleep than in her bed. Wink. I'm writing this while she's getting ready for bed in the bathroom, and I must say, I am delighted that Wallace decided to run off to Townsend.</p>
                            <p>Dear readers, I will see you bright and early ;D</p>

                            <p>I don't think I ever found Wallace. That thing I found... that wasn't him.</p>
                            <p>That thing that melted into my car seat and reformed outside?</p>
                            <p>That thing that was part of a neighborly community?</p>
                            <p>I don't think so.</p>
                            <p>If I'm being optimistic, that was just some projection of him the town created to trick me. But the way a house just... appeared for him. Like the town created a place for just him. And that thing at the center of town. I just... I don't even know what to think.</p>
                            <p>It's been about a two weeks since I've escaped Townsend, Pennsylvania. There's been no word from Wallace, but I still hold a naive hope that he's out there somewhere. The real him.</p>
                            <p>Out of desperation, maybe stupidity, maybe pure, sheer curiosity, I tried driving back to that place the other day. I couldn't find it. I found that same road where I had given up before, but no sign of the town. No sign of... much, really. The area felt a lot more desolate than before, even the ground looked more dead.</p>
                            <p>I've refrained from reaching out to anyone about this, until now, because... Well, I don't want anyone less lucky than me to make the mistake that I did. However, people need to know. For my own sanity, I need people to know.</p>
                            <p>This will be my final entry. I will attach the photo I was able to take in the center of town. I'm not sure... what exactly it is, but maybe someone else will have a better idea.</p>
                            <p>I had a nightmare last night. I was back there, and I was poking around in the center of town, getting closer to it... Then something flashed.</p>
                            <p>And suddenly... I felt so happy. So safe, so calm.</p>
                            <p>I stood on a lawn of my very own, and looked proudly at my brand new house at the town's end.</p>
