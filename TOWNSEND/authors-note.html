        <h1>Author's Note</h1>
        
        <p class="mb-8">Hi! The purpose of this page is to go over my creative process and intent while creating the webpages for Townsend. Feel free to put this tab beside the <a href="townsend.html" target="_blank">story</a> while you read it :)</p>

        <section>
            <h2>SETUP: <a href="index.html">The Pasta Creependium</a></h2>
            <p class="mb-4">For this page, I took direct reference from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112139/http://www.creepypasta.org/" target="_blank">a 2015 snapshot of Creepypasta.org</a>. As the closest thing to a central hub that the genre of creepypasta ever got, looking through old stories through the WayBack Machine was about my most useful resource when it came to recreating the style of the time period.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">Though Townsend is intended to take place a little earlier than 2015, I thought it might be more valuable to represent the popular idea of how a concept looks to get the idea across more effectively.</p> 
            
            <p class="mb-12">I can't lie, a lot of this page was me just having a bit of fun, although it was a good way to get myself into the mindset of being a early-mid-2000s pasta lover.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Almost everything on this page is a reference. For example, 'The Peeker' is taken directly from <a href="https://youtu.be/1xhhql_gpDY" target="_blank">"a normal creepypasta retrospective"</a>, which was the main inspiration for this project: to create a creepypasta culture for a fictional world that was just <em>slightly</em> different than ours.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The Panic! At the Disco creepypasta is an attempt at worldbuilding, showing the kinds of people who frequent this site. It's a little heavy-handed, but I think it gets across the idea that there are fangirls on this website.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The Goat Myth is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150317022702/https://forgotten-midgar.deviantart.com/art/The-Goat-Myth-Animal-Jam-458887102" target="_blank">real creepypasta</a> that I link in the project. I included it here because it is anecdotally significant to me and the themes of this project.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">I was talking about creepypasta with my boyfriend one night, and he remembered, in the back of his mind, this Animal Jam creepypasta about a goat. We scoured the internet for it, and right when we were about to give up, we found a piece of fanart (which, as of now, I cannot find) with a link to the original story. The link was dead, but it had been backed up on Archive.org. However, the fact that the actual creepypasta was technically "gone" and only lived on through its fanworks stuck with me; creepypasta stories, especially at the time, generally weren't treated with the best archival care, yet fans still did exist and create art from them.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">I made MARIO.JPG to show that the site did have some very young people on it, and also because I thought it was funny. Mario, and his stolen JPEG<sup id="ref1"><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup>, are the intellectual property of Nintendo.</p>

            <p class="mb-12">These stories, as well as adding to the site visually, do the job of setting up what the culture on The Pasta Creependium is like, which becomes important later on.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The rest of the site's content exists to further its authenticity, to set up jokes for later, or because I personally thought it was be funny to add for a final project of a class. "john cool" is the only username on the site with a space in it. I'm sure the implications of this are incredibly funny to only me.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>STORY: <a href="townsend.html">TOWNSEND</a></h2>
            <p class="mb-4">For this page, I was tasked to write a story that was iterating upon a work that didn't exist. Never showing the original story was always the plan from the conception of this project: only engaging with the original work through fan-works and discourse is the point of this story, as it reflects the experience of engaging with old and poorly documented internet horror (and, in a broader sense, fandom culture).</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">Also, if I was to actually write out the original, it would need to live up to all the hype these people give it. Admittedly, I don't think my prose is at the point just yet. Its absence lets people speak for its quality, though, which makes it way easier for me.</p>

            <p class="mb-12">I did write the outline of the original story, which is pretty much spelled out by the time you reach the <a href="discussion-townsend.html">discussion page</a>. I needed something to work with, so it was important to include key parts about it that people latched onto, and ways in which it would differ from its derivatives. Its main inspirations were the SCP Foundation for its formatting, and the ending to the 2013 found-footage horror film <em>The Borderlands</em> (a.k.a <em>Final Prayer</em>) for its concept of a creature's digestion system taking the form of a man-made building.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The purpose of the rewrite was to take most of the concepts of the original, and throw them into a completely different format and atmosphere. This one has actual characters, and follows a sort of male-power-fantasy action-movie type story.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">It had to accomplish four goals:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>Provide something more digestible for general audiences, which would lead to its popularity eclipsing the original</li>
                <li>Provide elements that a fandom could latch onto</li>
                <li>Be somewhat disrespectful to the original in order to piss off its fans and create discourse (even just calling it "the rewrite" instead of a fanwork does to much to show where it stands in the culture of the website)</li>
                <li>Introduce and build the character of Giles (the author) by what he chooses to bring to the table for this iteration</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4">I had a lot of fun writing this one. I think I was characterize Giles as kind of a pretentious douche without making him too unlikable for the work's popularity to be unrealistic; younger fans aren't really able to pick up on it, but fans of the original find it <em>insufferable</em>.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-12">Him naming the actual town 'Townsend' was the final straw, I think. Enabling and further popularizing this fan-misinterpretation led many original fans to frothing keyboard anger.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">When I was done with the rewrite, I went back to look over it with the question of "what elements would a fandom latch onto, no matter how small?", and the answer is, obviously,</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 mb-4">
                <li>The pretty lady</li>
                <li>The yaoi<sup id="ref2"><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup></li>
            </ol>

            <p class="mb-4">Since the lady was unnamed, a creating fanon<sup id="ref3"><a href="#note3">[3]</a></sup> name would be one of the first steps a blossoming fandom would take. I decided to go a nerdier route with it, because the male-power-fantasy-ness of it would probably appeal to that audience. However, no one would know how to pronounce Aglaope, so the nickname Aggy would stick a bit more. However, treating this fanon lore as gospel could create a rift in the already fractured-off fandom of the rewrite.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Wallace is a character that does not actually appear in the rewrite. He is described as a somewhat antisocial conspiracy theorist. It would make sense that he would become Townsend's own Tumblr Sexyman<sup id="ref4"><a href="#note4">[4]</a></sup>. And as the story's only other male character, it would have to be him that would get shipped with the protagonist.</p>

            <p class="mb-12">Having a character that, despite not actually appearing in the work, gets a proportionally huge amount of fan attention, was inspired by the vast amount of fanart and fanworks about/including December Holiday from *Deltarune*, a character who is only somewhat alluded to in the current state of the game. Again, fanworks overtaking the original.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The comment section acts as a segue into the discussion page, giving a snapshot of the different kinds of people in the fandom (and the website as a whole).</p>
